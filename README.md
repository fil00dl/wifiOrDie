# wifiOrDie
WIFI OR DIE is a browser action game, developed (with CreateJS and GSAP libraries) during the Ludum Dare 30.

You'll stay alive so long as you have a WiFi connection as you move between the planets.
The closer you get, the more points (and WiFi) you'll gain.

Controls :
- Move left and right to avoid crashing into the planets.
- Activate the wifi on the white planets by hovering your mouse.
